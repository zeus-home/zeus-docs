- Archana N. Shewale[1] describes the methodology of renewable energy based home automation in which two things are consider one is energy consumption and another is energy generation. In this, ZigBee is used for monitoring energy consumption of home equipment and power line communication (PLC) is used to monitoring energy generation.
- S. Anusha[2] describes the design and development of a remote household appliance control system using ATmega328 microcontroller and android mobile through GSM technology.
- J. Chandramohan[3] provides a low cost-effective and flexible home control and monitoring system with the aid of an integrated micro-web server with internet protocol (IP) connectivity for access and to control of equipment and devices remotely using Android-based smartphone application.
- Kumar Mandula[4] discusses about IoT and how it can be used for realizing smart home automation using a micro-controller based Arduino board and Android mobile app. In this paper, two prototypes namely home automation using Bluetooth in an indoor environment and home automation using Ethernet in an outdoor environment are presented.

- Debraj Basu[5] details the installation and configuration of unobtrusive sensors in an elderly personâ€™s house - a smart home in the making - in a small city in New Zealand. The overall system is envisaged to use machine learning to analyze the data generated by the sensor nodes.
- Kang[6] discusses about acquisition and analysis of sensor data which are going to be used across smart homes. It proposed an architecture for extracting contextual information by analysing the data acquired from various sensors and provide context aware services.
- Jeya Jeya Padmini[7] discusses about effective power utilization and conservation in smart homes using IoT. It uses cameras for recognizing human activities through image processing techniques.
- Pranay P.Gaikwad[8] discusses about challenges and problems arise in smart home systems using IoT and propose possible solutions.
